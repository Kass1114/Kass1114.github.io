					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that poeple identify elements first in thier general outlined form. This is because our brain recognises a simple, well defined object and not really deatiled ones. For example, a blueprint rather than a detailed picture. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when they discussed multi stability. For example, that people interpret objects in different ways. So, this means that someone will see the more dominant object because the other may be more heard to see. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> White space can boost visual hierarchy and information flow, contributing in easy to read and scan layouts. </p>
						</li>
