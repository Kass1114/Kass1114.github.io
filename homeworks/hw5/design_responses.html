                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned is that you can put videos within a website design. Also I learned that its really good to have contrast within a site to make it more clear what is important. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the artciles was seeing the differnet interfaces. I never really take the time to look at websites design other than when I am really confused on where to find things. These were really examples and I was not confused at to what information was being shown. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really liked the Netflix one. This is because the show or movie "Park" was in bold so I knew what this was about. I also really liked how the picture moves around so it makes you feel like you are in the series. </p>
