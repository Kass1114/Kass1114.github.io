					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that if you have a duration on an animation then you should give the user enough time to notice the change. This is important because then people can see what is being changed. You should also consider making the user not wait too much.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was when it talked about easing. Before I didnt know that you could do this in web design, I thought it occurred "naturally." Easing is important because it gives a more natural look, like linear and not paused.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "You need to remember that regardless of the platform the duration of the animation should depend not only on the traveled distance but also on the size of the object. " </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
